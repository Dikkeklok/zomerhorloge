First of all, thanks to everyone reading this. It is always a bit scary to start something new, especially before knowing if any of it will ever be successful or not. But...

In this day and age, mainly because of social media, it feels like everyone must be making X amount a month, driving a Lambo, travel to destination XYZ, without actually putting in the effort. Because not everything is real, and more and more fraud stories come to life, I thought it would be a good idea to share the actual, honest, progress of a blog/website/store/brand/? in the making. A place to collect my thoughts, freely share my opinion, and hopefully motivate or inspire others to go on a similar journey.

## Main reason
In addition to the above, one of the main reasons why I'm starting this blog is to keep myself motivated and to be completely transparent from the start. I might eventually try to monetize certain aspects of the website, e.g. through a webshop or other methods, and I do feel like trust is one of the most important factors in the e-commerce and watch industry. A lot of people (online) try to keep up this fake image of being successful without going into details. Attributing their success to hard work or skills, without ever going into details. Usually with a hidden agenda behind it (_'buy my course...'_).

## It is called a road for a reason
And it has to start, and end, somewhere... Being able to share my progress and milestones takes a weight off my shoulders. It allows me to be transparent, and public about things, even before any goal is (even ever) achieved. Being open and honest about my setup, from an operational, financial, and technical point of view, should also contribute to building trust. It is still unclear what the exact path is going to be but, hopefully, there will be a nice reward at the end. 

## Goal
The goal I've set for myself is in my opinion ambitious, but at the same time realistic. Being a watch enthusiast also makes this a goal that contributes to my hobby - and is also regarded as something that shows you're 'being successful'. The way I interpret this is that the project has resulted in success.

A lot of advertisements these days claim that it is super easy to make X amount a month while working from home, with basically no effort. I might try out some of these influencer tips to see if they are true - which will also allow me to explain why, or why not, certain tips are working. This all should result in interesting and educational content, that might inspire someone else to start a little side gig related to their own personal hobbies or interests.

## What's next?
For now, as you can tell, certain bits and pieces are already live. I will go back and retrospectively add blogs to explain how things started. I'll try to share as many details as possible.
